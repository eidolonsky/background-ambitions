      I'm a graduate student from China. I got my bachelor degree from Shanghai Jiaotong University majored in Communication. My study on communication is mostly in the form of theories and practice in traditional media(newspaper, magazine, TV) and journalism.

      In order to seek chance to further my study in communication with emphasis on Internet and web, I came to IIT, studying Technical Communication and Information Design.

     I take the hope of enhancing my abilities technically and broaden my horizons and knowledge in communication and information technology. With only several internship experiences, I would like to take the opportunity of more communication practices to lay the foundation for my future careers.

      Besides working in the field of new media, I am also looking forward to applying what I have learned into photography. It will be great to set up a personal photography studio online and I plan to take the first step as building up an online portfolio.
